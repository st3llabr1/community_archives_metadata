    <description xmlns="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">The New York Preservation Archive Project 
        is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to documenting, preserving, 
        and celebrating the history of historic preservation in New York City. 
        Recognizing the instructive and inspirational importance of this
        history to the continued health, success and growth of preservation
        in our City, the Archive Project hopes to bring these stories to 
        light through public programs, oral histories, and providing access 
        to information. The Archive Project is devoted to celebrating neglected 
        narratives of New York City historic preservation using the archives
        that hold these stories.</description>
    <context>The New York Preservation Archive Project was founded because 
        insufficient effort was being devoted to saving preservationâ€™s own history; 
        memories were frequently lost; lessons from campaign victories and defeats 
        were quickly forgotten; and noteworthy topics in this history were often 
        overlooked. To reverse this tide of loss and capture this endangered record, 
        the Archive Project conducts oral histories to record the memories of those 
        who made preservation history and makes transcripts available here. The 
        Archive Project also maintains a Preservation History Database, with key 
        information on people, places, organizations, and public policy significant 
        to the historic preservation in New York City.
